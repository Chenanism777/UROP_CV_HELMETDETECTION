# UROP_CV_HELMETDETECTION

This project is based on https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet and https://github.com/rafiuddinkhan/Yolo-Training-GoogleColab

Running on Google Colab Pro

Tensorflow and YOLOV3 are used to train the model.

The weights of 10000 iterations and 20000 iterations are available for helmet detection.

Still running the notebook to reduce the loss.
